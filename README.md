# TeamSynth: Organizing motivated teams to increase productivity

TeamSynth is an end-to-end Automated Personality Prediction pipeline for optimal team formation within organisations. It utilises personality analysis on email, Slack, and other textual communication to estimate the personality traits of employees. Auxiliary MBTI and Big 5 (OCEAN) classification tasks are used to improve accuracy. The personality embeddings thus generated can be used to determine compatibility between employees and minimise conflicts during the team formation stage.
