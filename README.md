# PBTFS: Personality-Based Team Formation System

This is a complete end-to-end pieline for optimal team formation within organisations. We apply personality analysis on email, slack, and other textual communication to estimate the Big 5 (OCEAN) traits of employees. We then use this information to suggest the optimal team formation for minimising conflict and thus maximising productivity.
