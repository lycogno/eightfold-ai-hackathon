# TeamSynth: Organizing motivated teams to increase productivity

TeamSynth aims to provide a complete end-to-end Automated Personality Prediction pipeline for optimal team formation within organisations. We apply personality analysis on email, slack, and other textual communication to estimate the Big 5 (OCEAN) traits of employees. The personality embeddings thus generated are used to determine compatibility between employees and minimise conflicts during the team formation stage.
